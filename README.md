spring-test-html-jsoup
======================

This is a small utility library that allows you to use the fluent API of the Spring MVC test framework in combination with the jsoup library for parsing HTML content. This library works best with our own jsoup matchers project that gives you a set of matchers for asserting your HTML content.
